# Body_Attraction_Simulator
 
In this project, I made a computer program to simulate how objects moves under the influence of gravity in 3D space. The program uses the numerical method Runge-Kutta Order 4 to calculate how things change over time, like how the position and speed of the objects change. We can use this program to understand how multiple objects, like planets, move together and see where they end up. This project involves a lot knowlege in computer programming, math, and science, and I hope it can help others learn and explore similar topics.
